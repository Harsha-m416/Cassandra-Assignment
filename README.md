Followed the instructions given by valentine in the Data Engineering with Python and Cassandra workshop to work with medallian architecture in cassandra database i.e. DataStax.
Created a database connection with datastax Astra and connected to google colab with secure connect bundle and loaded credentials from json token from the datastax.
I created the keyspaces for Bronze, Silver and Gold tables as bronze, silver and gold.
Then i used CQL queries to create the tables and processed the data.
